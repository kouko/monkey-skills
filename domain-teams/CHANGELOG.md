# Changelog

All notable changes to the `domain-teams` plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.5.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- `commands/skill.md` — slash command wrapper for `skill-team`, matching the
  convention used by the other 7 teams.
- `domain-teams/CHANGELOG.md` — this file. Consolidated version history.
- `standards/agent-interface.md` §"Output Footer Convention" — documents the
  `🔄 CHECKPOINT:` footer contract that workers and evaluators enforce.

### Changed

- `standards/agent-interface.md` §"Worker BLOCKED Handling" — replaced the
  plain-text BLOCKED format description with the structured JSON format
  actually used by `agents/worker.md`. Fixed drift between standard and agent.
- `agents/worker.md` — added explicit `output_language` handling rule to match
  `standards/agent-interface.md` §"Language Handling". Previously the
  evaluator documented language protocol but the worker did not.

### Fixed

- Drift between `skill-team/standards/agent-interface.md` and `agents/worker.md`
  discovered during v4.5.0 dogfood verification follow-up. The standard is now
  an accurate description of actual agent behavior.

## [4.5.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- `skill-team` — new meta-skill for building and modifying domain-team skills.
  Codifies conventions accumulated across the v4.2.0 / v4.3.0 / v4.4.0 grounded
  team refactors. Scope is deliberately narrow: domain-team skills only.
  Generic Claude skill authoring remains delegated to `superpowers:writing-skills`.
  - 6 standards: `skill-md-structure`, `file-conventions`, `gate-system`,
    `grounding-principle`, `agent-interface`, `commit-convention`
  - 4 protocols: `skill-brainstorming`, `grounding-research`,
    `new-skill-creation`, `skill-redesign`
  - 2 MUST gates: `skill-completeness-checklist`, `commit-split-checklist`
  - 2 SHOULD gates: `primary-source-grounding`, `skill-coherence`
- `using-domain-teams/SKILL.md` — new row in Available Teams table and 2 new
  rows in Intent Routing for skill-team.

## [4.4.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added

- `devops-team` grounding via primary sources:
  - Google SRE Book (Beyer, Jones, Petoff, Murphy 2016)
  - DORA / Accelerate (Forsgren, Humble, Kim 2018)
  - The Twelve-Factor App (Wiggins 2011)
  - Continuous Delivery (Humble & Farley 2010) + Martin Fowler bliki
  - GitHub Actions workflow conventions + security hardening
- `protocols/monitoring-design.md` — fixes previously broken Monitoring & Observability workflow (Phase 1 had `--` protocol placeholder)
- `rubrics/twelve-factor-compliance.md` — SHOULD gate for 12-Factor audit
- New workflows: DORA Metrics Baseline, Twelve-Factor Audit

### Changed

- `devops-team/SKILL.md` — persona rewrite anchoring on SRE/DORA/12-Factor/CD
- Added `Note on Global Context` section explicitly declining Japanese overlay
  (devops has no parallel Japanese tradition — honesty over symmetry)

## [4.3.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- `docs-team` grounding via primary sources:
  - Diátaxis framework (Daniele Procida) — 4 quadrants
  - Google Developer Documentation Style Guide (primary style authority)
  - Microsoft Writing Style Guide (secondary voice reference)
  - JTAP 技術文書 3 原則 第 1 原則 (書き手と読み手の違いを認識する) — reader-first preamble
  - Write the Docs docs-as-code philosophy
  - Standard README, Nygard ADR / MADR, OpenAPI 3.2.0
- New workflows per Diátaxis quadrant: Write Tutorial, Write How-to, Write
  Reference, Write Explanation, Write README, Write ADR, Write API Reference,
  Documentation Audit
- 3 MUST gates: Diátaxis Mode Clarity, README Completeness, ADR Structure
- 2 SHOULD gates: Style Convention, Freshness (with `NEEDS_METADATA` verdict)

## [4.2.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- `qa-team` grounding via primary sources:
  - ISTQB CTFL v4.0 (vocabulary, test levels/types/techniques)
  - ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 (test documentation structure, with "Stop 29119"
    note)
  - Japanese テスト観点 methodologies: VSTeP (西康晴), HAYST法 (秋山浩一),
    ゆもつよメソッド (湯本剛) — full parallel integration since JP tradition
    has equivalent standing to ISTQB
  - 品質は工程で作り込む quality philosophy
- Protocols: `test-viewpoint-extraction`, `test-strategy-selection`
- Rubric: `viewpoint-coverage` (SHOULD gate, cites ASTER テスト設計コンテスト)
- Checklist: `risk-register-depth` (MAY gate)

### Removed

- `standards/test-conventions.md` — self-invented, superseded by ISTQB grounding

## [4.1.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- `qa-team` skill (initial version, pre-grounding)
- `devops-team` skill (initial version, pre-grounding)
- `using-domain-teams` routing skill — the router for all domain-specialized teams

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: skill-agent dynamic integration. Skills now pass file paths to
  agents via Resource Paths Input Contract instead of inlining file content
  into launch prompts. Agents Read files themselves using their own tools.
- `code-team` split into `code-team` + `docs-team` by gate boundary
  (Security/Architecture MUST gates stay with code-team; Documentation has
  no MUST gates and moves to docs-team)
- `agents/worker.md` and `agents/evaluator.md` — added Input Contract section,
  First Action section (Read files before working)
- `code-team/standards/code-conventions.md` — added KISS/YAGNI/DRY principles
  with full names, Comments section with Docstring/Intent/Why/Why Not pattern
  reflecting Japanese community "なぜコメント" tradition

### Removed

- `agents/context-compressor.md` — YAGNI, compressing artifacts before
  evaluator loses evidence

## [3.x] — earlier

- Checkpoint architecture: prescriptive pipeline replaced by checkpoint gates
  with flat skills and open knowledge access
- 17 specialized agents collapsed to 5 generic agents + domain knowledge files

## [2.x] — earlier

- Phase-driven refactor: 17 agents → 5 generic + domain knowledge + hybrid eval
