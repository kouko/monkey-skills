## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-03

Conductor plugin born: the entry skill (`using-loom-pipeline`) plus the
build-assembled driver asset (`assets/loom-pipeline.js`, composed from
`scripts/driver_00_header.js` through `driver_60_ledger.js` — guard,
`runStation`, the 3 segments, ledger, and the `main` entrypoint).

- F1–F5 driver hardening baked in (per-station token budgets with
  fail-loud over-budget, wall-clock watchdog per station, rally cap
  ≤2 on critic↔writer loop-backs, change-strategy recovery ladder,
  stable-prefix dispatch convention).
- G1 (run-level + per-station token budgets), G3 (validator-checked
  Decisions section per artifact), and G6 (idempotent adopt-if-valid
  re-runs, journal resume, "checkpointed, not durable" naming) baked
  into the driver.
- G2 (critic false-positive rate) and G5 (per-judge verdicts,
  cross-vendor judging) recorded as ledger metrics — not solved in v1.
- Canonical 6-field run-input contract (change-id, project path,
  budgets, model policy, skillsRoot, optional resumeRunId), fail-loud
  on any missing required field.
- Fail-loud doctrine throughout: N/A conditions, missing fields, and
  over-budget runs all surface loudly rather than silently degrading
  or improvising a default.
