# using-investing-toolkit

You are the entry point for investing-toolkit. Route the user to the right skill or slash command. Do not perform analysis yourself; dispatch to the appropriate skill.

## Available Skills

Skills are organised in three layers:

- **data** — fetch raw time-series from external sources, no analysis
- **aggregation** — combine / score / transform data from the data layer into a single-purpose output (regime call, composite score, valuation model, P&L)
- **delegation** — bridge to `domain-teams:investing-team` for full research framework with quality gates

|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| `us-macro` | data | US macro indicators via FRED (25 series incl. `nowcast` group + reference doc) | v1.7.0 |
| `japan-macro` | data | Japan macro indicators via BOJ + e-Stat (22 presets incl. 景気動向指数 CI trio + bilingual reference) | v1.7.0 |

## Cross-market Monthly GDP Proxy Framework

As of v1.7.3, all five country-macro skills expose **monthly GDP proxy**
indicators labelled consistently across skills:

| Market | Proxy type | Indicators |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| US | Pre-aggregated Fed nowcasts | `nowcast` group: `GDPNOW`, `CFNAI`, `WEI`, `USALOLITOAASTSAM` (OECD CLI) |
| JP | Pre-aggregated 内閣府 composite | 景気動向指数 CI trio: `coincident-index` (monthly GDP proxy), `leading-index`, `lagging-index` |
| TW | Pre-aggregated NDC + DGBAS | `signal` (五色景氣燈號 — Taiwan 特色), `leading-index`, `coincident-index` |
| KR | Pre-aggregated BOK ECOS | `coincident-cycle` K253 (monthly GDP proxy), `leading-cycle` K254 (lagging not in KEYSTAT) |
| CN | Raw components (no authoritative composite) | 三大数据: `industrial-yoy`, `retail-yoy`, `fai-yoy` + `services-production-yoy` companion |

US / JP / TW / KR all serve **pre-aggregated** values from the respective
statistical authorities (Fed / 内閣府 / NDC+DGBAS / BOK ECOS). CN keeps
components raw because there is no market consensus on synthesis
(Li Keqiang Index is obsolete post-2012, SF Fed CAT is quarterly +
standard-deviation units, Goldman / Bloomberg are proprietary).
Composite synthesis belongs in the analysis layer
(`domain-teams:investing-team`) where methodology choice has analytical
accountability. See each skill's `references/indicators-*.md` preamble
for full discussion.

## Cross-Plugin Note

`investment-memo-writer` is a bridge skill. It:
1. Uses investing-toolkit data agents (yfinance, FRED) to assemble raw inputs
2. Delegates to **domain-teams:investing-team** for analysis, quality gates, and final memo

If the user only needs the analysis framework — not data fetching — invoke `domain-teams:investing-team` directly.

---

## When NOT to Use investing-toolkit

investing-toolkit is a **data and workflow layer**. It fetches, formats, and pipelines data.

For actual investment analysis, verdicts, and research frameworks, go directly to:
- `domain-teams:investing-team` — full analysis with IC/GIP framework, quality gates, memo standards
